Procrastination is one of the greatest challenges of modern life and is arguably _impossible_ to overcome.

It can be really challenging to focus on what's most important and push through feelings of resistance when starting a difficult task. What's more - the mind is particularly good at distracting us away from uncomfortable work, even at the times when doing it would benefit us the most.

But most people don't know that a simple, powerful and ancient tool can help us take control of our minds and free ourselves from procrastination. This tool is a method for training the mind, known as **meditation**.
