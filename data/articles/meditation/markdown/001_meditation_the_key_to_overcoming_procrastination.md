Procrastination is one of the greatest challenges of modern life and is arguably _impossible_ to overcome.

It can be really challenging to focus on what's most important and push through feelings of resistance when starting a difficult task. What's more - the mind is particularly good at distracting us away from uncomfortable work, even at the times when doing it would benefit us the most.

But most people don't know that a simple, powerful and ancient tool can help us take control of our minds and free ourselves from procrastination. This tool is a method for training the mind, known as **meditation**.

In this post, we'll explore how meditation can give you greater control over your natural impulses, increase awareness in daily life, and reduce distractions, which in turn helps reduce procrastination.

The mind is naturally inclined to wander and become [easily distracted due to hard-wiring in the brain](https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/mar/01/distracted-office-blame-evolution-workspace-design-focus), making it hard to control distraction - the mind's easy way out of daunting tasks.

This quote sums up the problem well. We must accept that, contrary to our belief, we are [not in control of our mind]().
