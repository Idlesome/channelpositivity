At a time when the word ‘mindfulness’ has taken on a meaning that is contradictory to the spirit of it’s original conception, we are overloaded with information about Buddhism, meditation and basic peace in life.


We’re also more over-stimulated, more worried about the future and more disconnected from our inner-selves than ever in human history.


When we’re enjoying life the most, our first thought is to capture the experience with a selfie, elbowing aside the real experience for a digital copy. But that selfie will never feel quite the same as the moment we just traded it for.


We find ourselves preferring to be in the digital world looking out at the real world, than in the real world looking in to the digital one.


Put another way, when you find a beautiful place - such as a forest, a lake, a mountain - sometimes it strikes you suddenly just how beautiful the world is. You’re taken completely off guard, and for a moment you can’t help but forget about everything else and just appreciate the moment.


Then a thought comes into your head “Oh, I must share this experience with the others!”, and then you switch from a state of peace, to a state of documenting. You were the monk, but you saw an opportunity to take the experience away with you and you became a scribe instead.


While you were recording the experience, it was passing silently away.


Last time you took a selfie in a moment like this, what do you remember most? Do you remember the way the wind felt on your face? The warmth of the sun? The smell of fresh air? I’d assume not, because those are not things you can record on a smartphone.


Even your memory of the experience is a shadow of the real thing. But one thing you **can** do is live the moment while you’re there, rather than lending it to some future.


This pattern is astonishingly common throughout the world. The sharing of the moment becomes more important than the moment itself. The method becomes more important than the purpose, the argument becomes more important than the person, the potential future becomes more important than the tangible present.


To the point where, rather than getting lost in the moment, we lose the moment and get swept away in the storm of our busy world. We actually don’t find the moment again for a good many weeks, months and years, or even a lifetime.


A particularly destructive manifestation of this pattern is obsessive ambition. This is not to say ambition is wrong; many good things come from ambition. Actually the problem is the obsession.


I thought I understood what it meant to value inner peace, but for a long time I felt something big was missing. Meditation was a temporary relief, mindfulness a chore, Buddhism merely a philosophy.


While understanding much of this in depth, I found there was too much information and one part of the puzzle would always contradict another. How can something that should be so simple appear so complicated?


For example, you may have heard of a method for meditation where you label your thoughts. One method I read suggested every time you think, you should note it by thinking the word “thinking”. The idea is you’re not getting swept away with a trail of thoughts and are always coming back to the present moment. Over time, you train your mind to stay in the present moment and you go for longer periods without thinking.


This all adds up logically, only there’s something really unintuitive about it, which is not obvious at first. The focus of the whole thing is thinking, but the result should be that you end up not thinking.


While this can be useful for disciplining the mind, the focus on thinking appears to be a distraction.


Other meditation methods say you should let your mind wander, notice when you’re thinking and then gently bring your focus back to the meditation; which may be to focus on the breath or some other sensation.


This again, is pre-occupied with sensations; it doesn’t dig deep enough to give us real insight. And it doesn’t seem like this is how the Buddha would have achieved enlightenment. Even if you were an expert in being aware of the breath, this alone cannot be the fundamental wisdom that is central to Buddhism and meditation.


So what are these techniques really getting at, and why are they taught in this way? Part of the issue is that the problem they are trying to solve is itself contradictory and difficult to explain. But the methods are easy to explain. So we end up with teachers who explain all method, and no purpose.


But it turns out, you don’t need the method, only the purpose. You can achieve the same thing without convincing yourself to sit down and “not think” every day. Actually, the transformation happens only when you **are** thinking. This is why people spend years meditating and get nowhere, they approach meditation like a weight-loss pill for stress.


While you can definitely reduce stress from practicing relaxation and mind calming techniques every day (you don’t need a study to prove that!), as soon as you’re done you re-enter the storm that is life and start stressing again. You don’t get lasting transformation, just a window of peace.


The process is much deeper and much more transformational, and it’s also much simpler, once you get your head around it.


This book is dedicated to cutting through the noise and confusion and getting right to the core fundamentals of **true** meditation, in a sensible way.


This is not neuroscience and it’s not spiritual. It’s what Buddhism was always meant to be; an exploration of the true nature of your reality.


And it all begins with a conversation.
