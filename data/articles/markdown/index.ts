        "\nStudying modern Buddhism is hard work. There are so many books on the topic, it’s actually very difficult to get to the core message of Buddhism. Even Reddit’s r/zen is a reportedly controversial and negative subreddit.\n\n\nYet the principles and messages in Buddhism are, in their nature very minimal and intuitive. In fact, it can be communicated far more purely through art than words.\n\n\nAlan Watts’ curiosity of Buddhism started with a simple piece of Zen art, which he said changed the way he saw the world, and made him extremely curious about the person who’d created it. How can someone from a thousand years ago paint mountains in such a profound way?\n\n\nAnd as he learnt more about the piece, he discovered it was painted by a monk, who had actually intended to invoke this reaction of wonder in the viewer.\n\n\nIn this way, this one piece of art sparked a life-changing curiosity; “just what was it that the painter saw which made the world so beautiful? I must find out what it is that he knows, for whatever he sees can only be more beautiful than what he has created here”.\n\n\nOf all the books I’ve read on Buddhism - written even by monks - I can say one piece of art like this can be worth volumes of books on Buddhism. \n\n\nAlan Watts regularly uses art, music and poetry to help us understand the concepts of Buddhism and reality. This is because it’s a more true way of communicating; words are always one step removed from the real thing.\n\n\nYet his way of communicating was through writing and lectures, and as he once pointed out, Lao Tzu said “The world that can be spoken of is not the true world”, yet Lao Tzu **said** that.\n\n\nSo it’s very important that we remember that the real insight comes from personal experience, not words.\n\n\nThis is a key purpose of Zen; which is known for is subtractive and minimalist style. Rather than studying meditation in elaborate detail, the Zen style is supposed to be much closer to the way the Buddha taught. Remove the unnecessary detail and focus on the fundamentals.\n\n\nOne Zen meditation guide is simply this: “just sit”. At first, this might come across as pretentious, but when considered carefully it can take on a profound meaning.\n\n\nWhat does it mean to “just sit” in this context? When you sit, are you doing something else? What happens when you try to sit without doing something else? Is that even possible?\n\n\nIt is through precisely this type of questioning that we start to learn about our own experience in the world, and this is where insight begins. This is that moment where Alan Watts saw the world through the lens of a Buddhist monk’s old painting.\n\n\nSo what is it, this process? This is what Alan Watts would describe as the true purpose of Buddhism: a conversation. More specifically, a conversation with yourself or an enlightened teacher (aka Buddha).\n\n\nThis is also the true purpose of meditation, or as Alan Watts would call it; “_contemplation”._ Because we only learn about our existence when we observe and challenge it; and this fits quite well with the Buddha’s philosophy of teaching.\n\n\nHe encouraged students to challenge his teaching, because he knew his students wouldn’t learn the concepts if they didn’t explore them for themselves. You can explain to someone in immense detail what a rose smells like, but until they actually smell a rose for the first time, they won’t be able to truly know what you mean.\n\n\n> “True understanding comes with experience”  \n> Lao Tzu\n\n\nThis is what the Buddha meant when he said people should learn Buddhism through “direct knowledge”. Because he knew he can’t explain your reality to you any more than he could look with your eyes.\n\n\nIn the modern world, we have become so absorbed with the technicalities of Buddhism, we mistake the method for the result.\n\n\nIf you meditate, do you know why you meditate? What do you want to get out of it exactly? Is it something you do because you think it will one day make sense? But if you’re not certain why you’re doing it, how can you know it will get you what you want?\n\n\nWe approach meditation in the same way that we approach a weight loss program. We feel it’s something we should do because it’s “healthy” and hope that if we stay consistent we’ll get better.\n\n\nBut it’s well known that there is a science to weight loss, and you have to find a lifestyle that is sustainable. Meditation is exactly like this; if you follow any meditation program, it will explain how meditation alone is not enough to give you insight into the true nature of your reality; you have to take the meditation away with you and practice it throughout every day, always being “mindful” of your friends and the sensation of the chair you’re sitting on, and so on.\n\n\nHowever, this again is not the core principle of meditation. The Buddha never said anything like “in daily life, make sure you remember to think about meditation and being mindful”, if he did it would not work, because then you’d become preoccupied with the method, rather than the result. This is like watering a rock and expecting it to grow roots and leaves. However, once you understand the result, the method is intuitive and makes sense. And it becomes a part of your lifestyle automatically.\n\n\nSo what is the result and why is it so elusive? This is the ultimate conundrum of Buddhism and meditation. It’s so hard to explain, people have written entire books on the subject and understood it less at the end. Yet it’s so simple, it can be found in a painting.\n\n\nThe reason it’s so hard to explain is because it’s not words, and it’s very individual. It’s something you just have to find out for yourself, in your own way. Nobody is going to explain it for you, and no amount of mind_less_ meditation will make it any clearer.\n\n\nThe only thing anyone else can do for you, is to do exactly what the Buddha did: point it out. You just have to start that conversation. Once it starts, you can start to explore your own experience and understand yourself - and therefore the world - in a new way. \n\n\nAlan Watts called this “cultivating a great doubt”, it’s a rational curiosity to want to understand the fundamental truth about existence and consciousness.\n\n\nThere are many ways to explore this, and it starts with simple questions and curiosity which we will cover in the following chapters.\n\n\nThe most important thing you need to know is this: external factors can nudge you in the right direction, but no matter how much you read, or how many gurus you speak to, nobody can walk the path for you, and nobody else can answer the questions for you. If somebody else found enlightenment, they cannot give it to you; you have to drink from the same cup that they did, as did Alan Watts and the Buddha. You already have all the answers, you just need to find a way to see them clearly. “When water is still it becomes clear”.\n\n",

      markdown:
        '\nUnderstanding your relationship with time is one of the most important and liberating concepts you can explore. There’s a lot that we take for granted about time which, when understood, can instantly and completely change how you experience life.\n\n\nOf course, we’re always busy imagining a future which never quite happens how we’d expected, or remembering a past; which is only a vague shadow of the real thing. Yet we have a strong sense that we can predict and control the future, and that our memory of the past is true and accurate.\n\n\nIn reality, memory is not completely accurate and reliable, and things never turn out exactly how we’d expect. The future and the past truly only exist in our minds as we remember or imagine them. Have you ever been so sure about a memory, only to find your memory was inaccurate or even false? Or have you ever imagined a future scenario and found the real event surprisingly different to what you’d expected?\n\n\nIt’s a strange thing to get your head around because we ultimately must rely on the past and future, or we’d not be able to function and interact with the world. Our understanding of life depends on the past, and our anticipation of the future (based on our memory of the past) allows us to navigate the world.\n\n\nOur relationship with past and future are clearly important, but if you’re constantly absorbed with an old memory or a potential future, you can very easily become burnt out.\n\n\nWhile we do need to remember things and plan ahead, it’s incredibly important to realise that past and future simply do not exist. They are constructs we’ve created to help us to interact with the world and each other.\n\n\n> The future is a concept. It doesn’t exist. As the proverb says “tomorrow never comes”.  \n>   \n> There is no such thing as tomorrow, there never will be. Because time is always now.  \n>   \n> That’s one of the things we discover when we stop talking to ourselves, stop thinking; we find there is only a present; only an eternal now.  \n>   \n> Alan Watts\n\n\nIt’s so easy to get wrapped up in thinking of the future, we often forget about the present for days, weeks, or even a whole lifetime. If you’re not careful, this can become your self-made prison; a world where you can never enjoy today for the fear of what tomorrow may bring.\n\n\nThe problem comes from believing that we need to control the future and that it’s actually possible to control the future. While we may be able to influence the future, our actual control over it is very limited. We imagine life like a mechanical instrument, where you operate a switch and things happen in the exact way they were programmed, when it’s a lot more like sailing a boat on a river; you can control the boat to a degree, but ultimately you are at the mercy of the river.\n\n\nAt first it can feel restricting to think you’re not able to control things as much as you’d like. But accepting this reality is actually liberating. When you accept what you **can** control, you can start to focus your energy on what you **can** change and stop worrying about the things you can’t.\n\n\n> “Accept what you cannot change, and change what you cannot accept”\n\n\nIt’s not possible to be prepared for every scenario, and by the time it comes around, so much will have changed, your expectations would likely be outdated anyway.\n\n\n> A man lived in a small village. One day his only horse ran away. The villagers said, “how misfortunate!”, to them the man replied, “perhaps”.  \n>   \n> A week later when the horse returned with seven more wild horses, the villagers commented, “how lucky! You’ve now increased your wealth by seven times, it’s a good thing your horse ran away after all!”, again the man replied, “perhaps”.  \n>   \n> The following day, the son of the man broke his arm trying to train one of the horses. Again the villagers chimed in, “how terrible it was that your horse ran away; now your son is injured and cannot work!”, the man replied, “perhaps”.  \n>   \n> The next day the military came by to conscript all the young men of the village. The villagers said “what luck! Had your son not broken his arm he would be conscripted to the military, it’s a good thing your horse ran away after all!”, once again the man replied, “perhaps”.\n\n\nThe Zen story illustrates the unpredictable path of life, which in retrospect always seems to make sense, but we actually don’t know what’s going to happen next. The villages are our own internal commentary, thinking they know something about how these events unfolded and the man represents the wisdom to know that you couldn’t reliably have predicted any of these things anyway.\n\n\nOn another level, if we **could** reliably predict what was going to happen next, there would be no sense of adventure in life. Watching a movie to which you already know the ending or playing a game in which you always win; it’s just not as fun or exciting.\n\n\nWhen you worry about the future, you’re borrowing happiness from the present moment for a potential future that you can’t do anything about now anyway.\n\n\nIt’s actually a great shame that we do this; we spend our lives worrying about things we can’t control while life gently passes us by. It’s like we’re always looking over our shoulder for something that isn’t there, while in front of us there is infinite peace.\n\n\nAs you explore this idea more, you will find that you can almost always find peace in any moment by letting go of identification with the past and letting go of trying to control the future. All there is, is now and not much else really matters. There is a time for rational planning of course, but if you don’t stop and appreciate the moment every now and then, life will pass you by.\n\n\nI strongly encourage you to explore and challenge this in your own way. Your relationship with time can drastically affect your day-to-day life, the key is to balance reflection and planning with respect for the present moment. You can’t live in the moment all the time - or at least, not effectively - but likewise, it’s not healthy to think only of the past or future.\n\n\nWhatever you think is important this week might not be so important next week, and certainly won’t be so important next month or next year. Bringing yourself back to the present moment often - and remembering that this experience that is happening right now is the true reality - can equally remind you of what’s really important.\n\n\nUltimately, the thing that causes us distress is not so much our interaction with time, but our emotional relationship with it; our attachment to it. If you can plan for the future without it changing how you feel now, you’re in a good place.\n\n\nOur idea of time flows linearly, past > present > future. An audio waveform is a great depiction of this; vibrations over time. In the image below, the black line represents now, and the left is the past, the right the future. The black line is always moving to the right.\n\n\n![Audio waveform representing time](/images/articles/there-is-only-now/audio-waveform-representing-time.png)\n\n\nThis way of looking at time implies the past is something that always exists and the future is something that is predetermined. However, Alan Watts suggests that the past doesn’t exist at all and that the future never will exist. A better illustration might be more like this:\n\n\n<iframe data-src="https://7806928b.channelpositivity.pages.dev/proton" style="width:100%;height:400px;"></iframe>\n\n\nWhere now is the centre, emanating out, creating the past and the future as experienced only in our minds.\n\n\nUnderstanding all this is one thing, but actually becoming free of future and past is another challenge altogether - however it is absolutely possible and we’ll learn how to do this in the coming chapters.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Suggested Meditations\n\n- How long is a moment?\n- Who would you be if you had amnesia and forgot all your memories?\n- What happened yesterday? How real does it feel in comparison to this exact moment?\n- How would daily life feel if you lived in a place where there were no appointments and you didn’t have a man-made way of telling the time?\n- Is the speed of time consistent? Why do some moments seem longer than others?\n- If you’re always waiting for tomorrow to come, how does that affect now? How will it affect you tomorrow if you’re still waiting? When will you be satisfied?\n',

      markdown:
        "\nZen by design is provocative. It’s intended this way to invoke a reaction or realisation from you; a moment of spontaneous enlightenment.\n\n\nZen stories are like riddles and can seem quite confusing, but they are all describing the same thing, and they are all paradoxical. If you take them literally, you will find them frustrating, confusing and meaningless. But actually, that means they’re working. In a way, that is exactly the kind of reaction they are intended to invoke.\n\n\nA key principle of Zen is that the more you try to explain something, the less sense it makes. By attempting to explain enlightenment, these stories serve as excellent examples of how silly it is to think we could put it into words in the first place.\n\n\nThis is why Zen masters will say things like “I have nothing to teach”.\n\n\n> When the great Zen master went to his teacher and asked,  \n> “What is the way to liberation?”  \n> The teacher replied,  \n> “Who is restraining you?”  \n> ”No one”  \n> ”If so, why should you ask for liberation?”\n\n\nThe stories approach the same problem but from different angles and with different levels of complexity. But always the intention is to make us aware of our own confusion; the futile search for external answers to a self-made problem.\n\n\nHow can someone else know the solution to a problem that you, yourself created?\n\n\nAnother story regales of a time when a powerful man visited the Buddha. When discussing attachment, the man explained how the death of his wife would be unimaginably painful for him, and he could not possibly continue to live without her. To this, the Buddha asked him, “if you could not live without her, how did you live before you met her?”\n\n\nMeeting his wife gave him great happiness, but why would losing her make him miserable? What if he’d never met her at all? He could look at the experience from the perspective that he’s been robbed; he deserves to have more time with her and the world is unjust. Or he could look at it from the perspective that he’s lucky to have met her and grateful to have had her in his life as long as he did.\n\n\nThis is a great example of how we experience life subjectively based on our conditioning. We always have a story for why we feel a certain way, or how we ended up here. But in reality, our experience is more or less the same as it always has been; it’s just the lens in which we view it that changes. This is why some people can have nothing, yet be completely fulfilled in life, while others have more than most could dream of having, but are deeply unsatisfied with life.\n\n\nOf course this isn’t something we can change easily, it’s deeply embedded and it starts from childhood. But it almost entirely dictates our experience. Most of the time we’re not aware of how our views shape our experience, but Zen serves as a way to remind us of this and shows us that we can “unlearn” some of these views which ultimately can make us quite unhappy.\n\n\nAnd so, the purpose of Zen is not to teach, but to unteach. It’s supposed to help you to let go of the unnecessary burdens in life. It’s like a mirror in which you can see your own overly-serious, heavy-hearted struggles as things you unknowingly carried. This is perhaps why enlightenment has been described as such: “It’s just like normal life, except about two feet off the ground”.\n\n\nThe purpose of the Zen master is to make you realise you’ve been programmed to behave in a certain way, and to undo the programming. If we look at life through a lens that has been shaped through our experiences, you could say the purpose is to clean the lens so it has no imperfections. The real point is to realise there never was a lens.\n\n",
