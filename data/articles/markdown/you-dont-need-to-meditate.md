It’s far more important to apply the fundamentals from Buddhism to your life than to practice meditation; **one moment of understanding could be more valuable than a lifetime of daily meditation if it gives you insight into your reality**.


This aim of this book is to be a practical, no-nonsense guide to understanding and applying these principles. It also aims to dispel misconceptions about Buddhism and explain the core concepts of it’s principles, which are often missed out or misinterpreted in modern meditation literature.


I’ll explain why so much information on Buddhism and meditation appears contradictory and confusing and hopefully provide more practical answers to questions like “why should I meditate?” - and the answer (in short) is not just to be happier or to be more relaxed, although it certainly can have that effect.


By the end of this book, you should have the framework for inner peace and freedom that Buddhism originally intended; not vague instructions or repetitive rituals but clear, practical steps and concepts that will have an instant and lasting affect on your daily life without having to schedule time for counting your breaths or trying not to think.


---


These days, the word ‘mindfulness’ has taken on a meaning that is contradictory to the spirit of it’s original conception. We are so overloaded with information about Buddhism and meditation that we tend to get pre-occupied with the practice of Buddhism, rather than it’s core message and promised benefit: basic peace in life.


We’re also more over-stimulated, more worried about the future and more disconnected from our inner-selves than ever. The reason for this is less about the effect of technology on society and more about how we view our experience. We habitually focus on thoughts and feelings that make us unhappy, rather than focusing on the things that really matter in this life.


While we’re absorbed with what to cook next week, the disagreement from the other day or the best way to achieve that new goal, the world is gently flowing on as we pass it by in a completely internal state. We might not even notice the birds singing outside, the perfect stillness of the air or how lucky we are to be fed, sheltered and in good health. What is really more important? And why do we automatically focus on worrying instead of finding peace with the moment? How do we practically navigate life _without_ worrying?


Even when we can get to the state where we’re able to be present and free from worry, the big problem that nobody seems to address is that **the worry always comes back**. No matter how much you meditate or get into a relaxed state, you’ll always have to re-enter the world where bills need to be paid and plans need to be made; and it’s in this world where we find the greatest our challenge to inner peace.


No matter how good you are at meditation, if you don’t find a way to master your inner peace in the business of everyday life, you could spend the majority of your life in a stressed state, only to be calm for 20 minutes a day when you meditate.


While there are resources that talk about bringing “mindfulness” into everyday life, becoming aware of your breathing or other sensations does not seem to be the answer to this puzzle. In fact, people with anxiety will find these “mindfulness” techniques make their symptoms worse. I can personally say I’ve experienced a lot of anxiety in my life and focusing on physical sensations or my breathing only intensifies a panic attack and increases the feeling of disassociation.


I thought I understood how to achieve inner peace, but for a long time I felt something big was missing. Meditation was a temporary relief, mindfulness a chore, Buddhism merely a philosophy.


While I understood much of this in depth, I found there was too much information and one part of the puzzle would always contradict another. How can something that should be so simple appear so complicated?


For example, you may have heard of a method for meditation where you label your thoughts. One method I read suggested every time you think, you should note it by thinking the word “thinking”. The idea is you’re not getting swept away with a trail of thoughts and are always coming back to the present moment. Over time, you train your mind to stay in the present moment and you go for longer periods without thinking.


This all adds up logically, only there’s something really unintuitive about it, which is not obvious at first. The focus of the whole thing is thinking, but the result should be that you end up _not_ thinking.


While this can be useful for disciplining the mind, the focus on thinking appears to be a distraction. It’s like digging yourself out of a hole.


Other meditation methods say you should let your mind wander, notice when you’re thinking and then gently bring your focus back to the meditation; which may be to focus on the breath or some other sensation.


This is pre-occupied with sensations; it doesn’t dig deep enough to give us real insight. And it doesn’t seem like this is how the Buddha would have achieved enlightenment. Even if you were an expert in being aware of the breath, this alone cannot be the fundamental wisdom that is central to Buddhism and meditation. You are not going to learn much about yourself by repeatedly forcing your mind to focus on sensation.


So what are these techniques really getting at, and why are they taught in this way? Part of the issue is that the problem they are trying to solve is itself contradictory and difficult to explain. But the methods are easy to explain. So we end up with teachers who explain all method, and no purpose.


But it turns out, you don’t need the method, only the purpose. You can achieve the same thing without making yourself sit down and “not think” every day. Actually, you need to think to get the transformation. It’s in this way that we could spend years meditating and get nowhere; we approach meditation like a pill for stress and it’s much easier to use a daily “hack” than try to understand the cause of the problem.


While you can definitely reduce stress from practicing relaxation and mind calming techniques every day (we don’t need studies to know that!), as soon as you’re done you re-enter the storm that is life and start stressing again. You don’t get lasting transformation, just a window of peace - and that’s only if you’re good at meditation.


The true process is much deeper and much more transformational, and it’s also much simpler, once you get your head around it.


Our modern society is overwhelmed with information, living through a digital world, and when we get burnt out, we turn to the latest trick for fixing stress which is usually behind a paywall: meditation. As I will explain, this commercial meditation no longer means meditation in it’s original meaning, just in the same way that mindfulness today means “being aware of your surroundings”, when it’s original translation comes from the word “vipassana” - better translated as “insight”.


It’s in this exact way that we’ve become pre-occupied with ideas like “mindfulness meditation” when what we really want is “insight meditation”. In the end, you won’t need any meditation because you’ll find out how to remove the source of the suffering rather than just treating the symptom.


> Buddhas - who are supposed to have attained everything - are invariably shown in some sort of meditation posture. Why should they meditate anymore? Because that just happens to be the way that a Buddha sits when he sits. When he sits, he sits. When he walks, he walks. He’s not going anywhere. He’s just going for a walk because he digs it.  
> Alan Watts


That’s why this book is dedicated to cutting through the noise and confusion and getting right to the core fundamentals of **true** meditation, in a sensible way


You will be able to fully understand and apply these fundamentals to your life, without being overwhelmed with vague instructions or bored with repetitive tricks that will one day work. This is a practical, down to earth approach to what meditation is supposed to achieve.


You won’t need to “meditate” in the modern typical sense at all, **all you need to is to be willing to explore concepts and ideas**.


This is not neuroscience and it’s not spiritual; this is what Buddhism was always meant to be; an exploration of the true nature of _your_ reality. It’s a unique, personal journey.


This is why it was so important to the Buddha to encourage people to examine and challenge teachings based on their own discernment and understanding rather than accepting them blindly.


And, as Alan Watts explained, this understanding all starts with a _conversation_.
